# Hi ,I'm Amr Zidan 👩🏻‍💻📊

Hello, I’m Amr Zidan, a **Data Analyst** with more than a year of hands-on experience. I’ve worked on several real-world projects where I focused on **analyzing data**, **identifying patterns**, and **turning insights** into **actions** that support better **decision-making**.

I have a solid background in **statistics**, which I use to understand data behavior and uncover trends. I work with **Excel** for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, **Power BI** for building clear and interactive dashboards, and **Miscrosoft Sql Server** to extract and manage data from databases. I also use **Python** for predictive analysis and to forecast future outcomes.

I’m passionate about using data to solve problems and help companies make smarter, data-driven decisions.
